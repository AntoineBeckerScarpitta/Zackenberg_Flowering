BioBasis Nuuk - Vegetation - Loiseleuria phenology and total count
For Loiseleuria procumbens four observation plots were established in order to cover the ecological amplitude of the species with respect to duration of snow cover, difference in soil moisture at the site and altitude. The number of flowers is counted on a weekly basis diveded into the number of buds, flowers and senescent flowers. Total flowering is counted once per year, at peak flowering. For further details, please refer to the newest BioBasis manual available at the website.
